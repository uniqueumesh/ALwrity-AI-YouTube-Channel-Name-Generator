# ALwrity Project Structure and Principles

This repository contains the ALwrity AI YouTube Channel Name Generator. The authoritative plan is in [PLAN.md](mdc:PLAN.md).

## Core Principles
- Single‑screen Streamlit UI, no sidebar. All inputs on the main page.
- Users provide their Gemini API key via the UI. Do not persist keys.
- Target model: Gemini 2.5 Flash.
- Keep components loosely coupled so work/errors in one part do not break others.

## Intended Folder Layout (when implemented)
```
app/
  ui/       # Streamlit widgets and layout only
  core/     # Prompt building, input validation, output parsing (no network)
  services/ # Gemini API interactions and external IO
  utils/    # Formatting, de‑duplication, clipboard/export helpers
  state/    # Session state helpers
assets/     # Logos, screenshots
```

## Development Guidance
- Keep business logic out of `ui/`. UI files should call functions from `core/` and `services/`.
- `core/` must be deterministic and testable without network.
- `services/` should be thin and mockable. Handle all network/retry concerns here.
- Respect the acceptance criteria in [PLAN.md](mdc:PLAN.md).
